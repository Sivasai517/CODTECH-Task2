Overview of the Project

Project:Python Program to Track and Manage Student Grades

*Project Objective:*
Develop a Python program that enables users to efficiently track and manage student grades. The program will support the input of grades for various subjects or assignments, compute the average grade, and display the overall grade with additional information such as letter grades or GPA.

*Key Features:*
1. *User Input:*
   - Allow users to input student grades for different subjects or assignments.
   - Input can be done through the console or a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

2. *Grade Calculation:*
   - Calculate the average grade for each student based on the input grades.
   - Compute the overall average for multiple subjects or assignments.

3. *Grade Display:*
   - Display the overall average grade for each student.
   - Convert numerical grades to letter grades based on predefined ranges.
   - Calculate and display the GPA.

4. *Additional Information:*
   - Provide detailed information about each grade entered.
   - Include the option to display individual subject/assignment grades along with their respective averages.


*Project Extensions:*
- *Graphical User Interface (GUI):* Implement a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt for more user-friendly input and output.
- *Database Integration:* Store grades in a database for persistent storage and advanced querying.
- *Reporting:* Generate detailed grade reports and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).

*Conclusion:*
This project provides a solid foundation for managing student grades with Python. The program is easily extensible and can be enhanced with additional features to meet specific user needs.
